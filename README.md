# Technical-Task

Open Python Script in applicable software (Spyder, Jupyter Notebook etc).

When Script is ran, it will produce a pop-up window asking you to select your CSV File of choice. 

When CSV file is chosen, the script will filter the speeds in the file with a Fast Fourier Transform and generate an excel sheet with the details of the top performing athlethes in various categories; Top Speed, Distance travelled in Speed Zone 5 (19.8 km/h - 25.1 km/h), and total distance travelled. These categories will only be counted if the player is **within the pitch boundaries**. 

When the script is finished, another pop up will prompt you to select the folder you wish the Excel output to be saved into (Excel name: Technical Task Output). The excel will be split into separate sheets for each category designated previously.
